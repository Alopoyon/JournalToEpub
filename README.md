## Journal to Epub

This project aims to convert research papers to epub (for now) for easier convenience when reading these from a phone.

I'll begin with testing each python library which would best suit to extract  plain text while ignoring special objects in PDFs.

        <li>PyPDF2</li>
        <li>PyMuPDF (fitz)</li>
    </ul>

Once text can be extracted consistently from PDFs with selectable text,  I'll be moving on to extracting tables and other objects with the exception of images.

Then I'll be working on extracting text from images and unselectable PDFs.
